When We Cease to Understand the World by Benjam√≠n Labatut.<p>It is about scientists that are fully consumed by their work, going mad somtimes. Their work is making a world a better place, but at the same time is used to kill lots of people.<p>This is the first book for me that I can say is beautifully written. Even though the subject was heavy at times, I couldn't stop reading it.

I have one suggestion. Find the place where you want to work. Get the email of the hiring person. Record a video introduction and send it along with a description of why you are the best person for the work.<p>This will put you above everyone else! You are almost guaranteed to go through the door and then it is up to you to prove you are awesome, which I have no doubt you are!<p>Self-plug: I built a tool to help you find the perfect job for you (and you can filter on whether the job posting has an email) <a href="https://gettjalerts.com/jobs/" rel="nofollow">https://gettjalerts.com/jobs/</a>

What you know best!<p>For me it would be:<p>*Django* for backend with the built-in templates. No frontend backend split.<p>TailwindCSS for styling.<p>StimulusJS for sprinkling JS wherever needed, which is not very often.<p>Postgres as my DB (although if I'm not integrating Stripe, SQLite will suffice).<p>Maybe Redis for caching and as a broker for background tasks, if needed.

Reading other comments now and have to agree with them that first you should take some time to stabilize you life, emotionally. Having kids will be a great undertaking (both before they are born and after).<p>So, talk to your wife, talk to your therapist, and anyone else you trust. Make sure you will be happy with your life, whether you have kids or don't and only then try having them.<p>Don't forget, that after your kids have grown up, they will go on to live their own lives and it will be just you and your spouse left. So make sure you have a good relationship with her.

If your spouse of the same opinion, that she wants kids than there are many options. If she doesn't want kids than this is a tougher problem to solve and I won't be able to advise on it. But let's assume she does.<p>1. Talk to a doctor and see if your wife would be able to bear a child. If doctor approves and your wife is ok with it, give it a shot. If you wife is not ok with having to go through a pregnancy in that age (which is totally understandable), then try #2.<p>2. If you are stuck on an idea of biological children you could try finding a surrogate mother who will bear your child for you. As far as I understand it is your sperm and your spouse's eggs are used, so the child will have your genes. This might be expensive, but is a good solution. Again, talk to a doctor about this possibility. Perhaps during the same visit as #1.<p>3. If for whatever reason, #2 is not an option, there is another option, which I honestly think should go as #2. Adoption. There are a lot of kids that have been abandoned by there parents. It is always heartbreaking to think about their lives. There are of course a lot of things to consider, but in the end I think it will be a win-win situation for all parties involved.<p>I'm sure there are more options that I didn't think about, so don't think that life is over. Kids or no kids, you will find a way to add meaning to your life. There is no need to leave your wife or get bad diseases, regardless of the outcome.<p>Just remember that everything will be fine.

The thing is that I don't like "sales people" for the most part, I don't want to listen to their advice.<p>I'm interested from hearing thought of other programmers / developers that created something small and were able to "sell" it. I think this advice will be much more applicable than from a "sales person".<p>I might be wrong, but I feel like sales people learn the wrong thing on the job. If you read other comments it seems that small businesses are getting swarmed by soul-less calls from these people that will lead nowhere. That is the exact thing I want to avoid.

1. It could be a huge mistake I built a whole startup around my business idea. The reality is that the code was simple, it took me ~2 week of not too involved coding. So, if it doesn't pan out, it's not like I wasted a ton of time or money.<p>2. It could very well be the case that no one needs my solution to a problem that I have (perhaps) imagined. However, if the problem does exist, I thought it would be better to be able to show the prototype as to how it would solve their problem.

For me, it was a little surprising that there was no effect at all. For whatever reason it felt like it ought to have an impact.<p>However, if I think about it, reading has been done for thousands of years and by now something like that would have prevailed if it was effective.<p>Anyway, we need more experiments like this. I bet there are a ton of things out there that we think make out lives better, but in reality don't do a thing.

Valid point. I'm sure there are people who would approach this that way. At the same time, I feel if you are interested enough to go through the whole thing and still brag about it that way, than you read them wrong :)<p>At the point I am at life I don't yet know what I'm deeply interested in, so this is a way for me to get general education, get some exposure to variety of texts that have been written across time and see if anything spark joy. I'm not planning to pain through the books. If I'm not enjoying something I can freely skip. If something sparked interest, I'll be sure to reevaluate the list.<p>Thanks for the typo note, fixed it.

> Customers don't even want to download more apps, let alone pay money for them.<p>Interestingly, I found myself thinking about this and thought about it a little different. I indeed want to have as little apps on my phone as possible, but that made me want to increase the quality of those apps. And thus I wasn't against paying for those if they are indeed better quality.<p>It's like with cooking. If your dish uses less ingredients, you can focus on better quality ingredients then.

TL;DR - I'd say try learning and building with both and see which one makes more sense. You don't even have to think which is better for your career, as frontend, backend, fullstack can all find good paying jobs. What matter is you enjoying your work.<p>I'm a self taught software engineer, and have about the same experience as you.<p>I knew a little bit of python when I started learning and thus decided to learn Django (backend), really liked it (even then CSS was giving me the most trouble).<p>Then decided to learn JS to get a more well-rounded education, but hated it. Now I use Hotwired techniques for my web apps, to the least amount of Javascript possible.

Well, making it open source is not the same as making regular citizens/programmers to work on it.<p>You still pay the company to develop and maintain the software. Same way as open source developers get "sponsored". The reason is that anyone who wants to see the code and suggest on how to make it better, or to report a bug, then that would be possible. Furthermore, that work can be reused by other parts of the government.<p>That last point is why some companies wouldn't want to do it, or would charge more. However, to your point, I think the increased cost is worth it in this case.<p>Sure, there are going to be less better roads/schools by 500k, but the problem with that money is that there are rarely big projects for that amount, so it's not like they would be put to best use without being "lost" in the process of relocation.

Yes, I use it for builtwithdjango.com . I have not a single bad thing to say about it, not one!<p>It is so convenient to have it as a file, especially when you are just learning to do software development.<p>And the performance has not been an issue once.<p>One thing to note is that my site is not Facebook size. It only gets ~40 page views a day. And most of them are just for viewing, so no database opertaions.<p>So, I'm not going to be the most credible voice here. FWIW, I know that Pieter Levels, who runs multiple projects like nomadlist, remoteok, rebase, uses both SQLite and plain JSON files for storage.

I think this plays to two human traits. One is the need to remember and thus right something down. Humans have been doing this for years. Second is trying something new.<p>And you are right, trying something new is exciting. I remember when I first discovered Evernote, I thought it was super cool, then Roam, then Obsidian.<p>But I think the following will happen at some point in your journey (at least it happened to me). You will find a system/approach that works for you and you will not want to try other things. The workflow that I have configure for myself with the use of Obsidian, Readwise, and a couple of other tools, that the hustle of moving it to some other stack is just too big. It is so big in fact, that it trumps the novelty card completely.

I really wanted one ever since they announced the first model, but something has been stopping me. Now that I'm a little older and mature I realize that my instincts not to buy this thing were completely right.<p>How can a device like this not have an ability to make annotations?... What's worse, the highlights you make on the book are not indexed. To me, it's insane.<p>I think one can hack this together with Kobo, I believe. But should you really buy a device for $500+ to hack it together?<p>Once this device supports proper E-Reader features, it will be a great iPad alternative, IMHO. And I'll be a big purchase candidate.

A lot of awesome points! Thank retzkek.<p>1. If Chess.com or LiChess were to do something like that I would immediately stop this project, as the main idea here is quantity and those guys can't be beat when it comes to that.
  - The problem is that it might be technically complicated for them to do any time soon, at least in a format that you have mentioned. Additionally, they'll have to worry about the legality and the security of users.<p>2. The idea is that a person from London, for example, says that he can be at some location at some time and if someone with similar rating replies then they can meet. Additionally I ask people to recommend general chess gathering locations in relevant chanels. I will keep adding them to the main message in the topic, so that if someone is uncomfortable they can just visit that location and with great likelihood find a partner.

I have mixed feelings.<p>I have been keeping and growing my Zettelkasten with Obsidian for about a year now. I can't say that it have been extremely useful, in terms of the work I produce, but that is clearly my own fault. I do expect that at some point I will start producing more writings from my Zettelkasten.<p>Meanwhile, I suggest you don't get discouraged. Start simple. Download Obsidian (obsidian.md) and start making notes. I like to keep the following format:<p>"""
[[Source of Idea / Book / Article / Tweet]]<p>> quote that sparked my though<p>my actual thought.<p>Tags: [[Thinking]], [[Thoughts]]
"""<p>And continue connecting. Don't be too harsh on yourself, keep  growing it slowly and you will reach a point where your graph is very superconnected.

Your site looks awesome, will be sure to add it to builtwithdjango.com.<p>Regarding your issue, you could try adding a for to an existing "View" via get_context_data. Then in the HTML add action tag to your form that with the actial Form View endpoint. This should allow you to have more that one form on a page. I agree that was a little annoying for me at first too. Maybe I'll write a post on how to do this.<p>Otherwise splitting the frontend from the backend can be a solution too. This will probably take a little more time.

I'd say depends on the program language you are most familiar with. For example, if you know Python the best, you should definitely Django. If you are a Javascript person, go for Node.js, if Ruby then Ruby on Rails. You get the point :) Use your current experience to your advantage.<p>If you don't know programming, I'd recommend learning Python and then Django.

I wrote a small intro about Joplin -> <a href="https://rasulkireev.com/joplin/" rel="nofollow">https://rasulkireev.com/joplin/</a> .<p>I use Joplin as a storage for some of my thoughts on different topics. I organized my library with the PARA method. It works like a charm.<p>I use Obsidian as my Zettelkasten. I don't try to use it as my productivity driver. As a simple storage and connector for my thoughts it is perfect.

Agreed. In Joplin internal linking is a pain and that makes it a bad Zettelkasten. However, Joplin is not meant to be that, Joplin is more of an Evernote alternative, which is made for collecting information rather then connecting it. For that Joplin is awesome.<p>For my Zettelkasten and writing I use Obsidian. They are fantastic in tandem.

IMO, the advantage of apps like Obsidian is that you don't have to organize everything meticulously.<p>1. You just create a new note,
2. give it some tags in square brackets "[[Tag]]"
3. and if it direcrly related to a note you recall making, make that connection<p>That's it. With time the amounf notes grows, and the amount of interesting connections grows too.<p>It is also important to note, that the process should note be automated. If you want to learn something, you need to make the time to write the note yourself, as opposed to simply copy/pasting.

I agree about the spamming. Which is why I am asking this question here. I'm trying to put some content out there without it being spam and getting honest feedback in return. Sometimes, it's obvious to myself what I need to improve, but there are multitide more things that other people can direct my attention to.<p>The goal of making such tutorials is not always making money. I can't speak for everyone, but in my case I have two goals in mind:<p>1. Improve my speaking/presentation skills.
Consequentially, improve my writing skills after writing a prep and a follow-up post.<p>2. Put myself out there.
If the content is bad, I'll get a ton of negative feedback and will have no other option but to improve. If I'm good I'll get a chance of gaining a following, getting better job opportunities/higher salaries, etc.<p>There are many more good reasons why a person might want to share his content with the world, even if it is in broken English.<p>Finally, you as a consumer of such content always have an option to walk away, which is very powerful. If I put up shitty content, people don't have to consume it. However, some people might push through an give me some feedback. With each article, I'll get better and therefore attract more reader and feedback, creating this loop of learning.<p>So, advice to not post something, just because it is not good, is a bad advice. I would recommend people share their work, even if it is far from perfect.<p>Big caveat. I am talking about honest people with the best intentions in mind.

I totally agree. It's an overkill for most projects to fully separate the backend form the frontend. Django gives you everything you might need to build a fully capable app.<p>Maybe makes sense for Google, but not for most people working on side projects.

If you are looking to ship, then do not separate the backend and frontend too much. I'd pick Django for the backend and "sprinkle" some javascript (vanilla or stimulusjs or alpinejs) on top of the html.<p>The trouble of of separating frontend from backend fully is just not worth it, in my opinion.

Certainly Personal Blog!<p>You can always cross post on Medium and other such services. Just got to remember include the canonical URL.<p>That way you get the advantage of being searched on services like Medium, Dev.to and others (although, I don't think this is much since most search via Google). And you get the advantage of owning the content and your own personal brand.

Another advantage of digital is search. Not that I use it regularly, but it can be useful in the future.<p>In defense of paper, I can say that with OCR technologies developing more and more in the future it will be no problem to move all hand written notes to a digital system.

One big advantage of digital for me is that when using digital journal you can parse all the text with a  script and do some sort of analysis on the journal entries (# of words, time it took to write, which words are used the most, etc.). Apart form this I'm not sure. That said, I've never actually used this, but want to in the future.

Hey all,<p>Just made a quick post on adding emails to Pocket. This is somehow not a native Pocket feature, so I found a quick workaround.<p>Using publishthis.email you can simply turn any email into a webpage and then save to Pocket.<p>This will make it extremely easy to make notes on any email course and useful newsletters.<p>Please let me know if you have any feedback on the post, design or whatever. Would love to improve :)
