Please organize the summary into these sections:

## Key Accomplishments & Impact
- List 5-7 major achievements with quantifiable results where possible
- Focus on projects that demonstrate technical skills, leadership, or business impact
- Use action verbs and specific outcomes

- 08:06 Don't really want to write anything. Feeling a little tired.

  Yesterday went to bed a little later, due to a fuck up. Wanted to install hand held bidet thing, but screwed up. Installed the first valve at a slight angle (even though in the manual it specifically warned against that), and it is now stuck, can't unscrew. So I wasted a good deal of my Saturday evening on that. I filed a ticket in our building system, hopefully someone comes to help out today.

- 06:59 What a weird morning.
  - [[Theodore Kireev|Theo]] woke up at 4:50 and kept crying...
  - [[Tatiana Dema|Tanya]] got up with him around 5:50 and took care of him
  - She woke me up at around 6:30 to switch with me.
  - While I was was drinking coffee they both fell asleep
  - And now I'm here.

- Read a bit of [[The 4-Hour Workweek 202011011328]]. Trying to get re-inspired to continue the journey to financial independence. It did a good job, as per usual.

  Make me happy that a lot of the things from the book that I aspired to do in the past have been achieved. I work remotely, I am "Liberated", I don't have to many distractions, it has been "Eliminated". Now I need to work on Automation and Definition.

  In terms of Definition I think I know what I want, just need to put it in writing and be even more specific about what I want.

  And then the most important bit of all is to setup my Muse... The book prescribes an info product in the industry you are familiar with. I can sure start with Django. This is a low hangin fruit. Make a book and a video course.

  I like the idea of doing a book with [[PragProg]]. I was thinking of sending them a copy, but instead I will email them now and describe my idea. Starting my proposal here: [[Agile Web Development with Django 4 - Proposal]]. Let's aim to complete it by EOD.

  I also like the idea of doing a paid video course with a book through Gumroad, or something like that. Also, related to Django. I'm thinking something like this:
  - Build a SaaS with Django
  - Applied Django (all about the thing you would to make projects for yourself, not an employer)

- 08:09 Today was difficult to wakeup. Don't have the drive to wake up at 6 in the morning to do that whole 2 ritual for Theodore... Not sure what to do about it.

  I guess the fact that he has been waking up at 4:30 am doesn't help. If he were to sleep through all the way to 6 would be easier, since I do go to bed pretty early (10:30pm + 15 minutes of reading). Clearly, that's not enough though.

  Looking through the [[Kodak]] camera now. Looks like [[Tatiana Dema|Tanya]] is feeding him, after he refused to sleep and started crying.

  Tags: [[Sleep]]

- 08:38 Did some tab cleanup on the browser, now I'm thinking on what I should do next. Want this to be meaningful:
	- Watch 0 to LSP by [[ThePrimeagen]] to help me migrate to neovim.
	- Start doing update to "[[Built with Django]]" that I promised in the newsletter.
	- Prepare docs to send to the Russian Embassy.

- 12:31 Gave up on learning Vim, yet again. This time a simple Search and Replace got me... The Command+D in VScode is deal breaker for me.

- Lately have been obsessed with an idea of playing games...

  Not sure why, I've never really been a games person, besides Fifa.

  My first theory was that I am a little tired and overwhelmed by the tasks that are occupying my brain and I thought that this would help me relax a bit.

  Another weird thing is the genre of the games that I want to try. I keep coming back to the idea that I want to learn how to play D&D. I want to play Diablo 3. I've never been that "adventure" person, but for some reason these games have been calling to me lately. Maybe my subconscious is desperate for some adventure?

  Maybe this is a good chance to play something adventorous with [[Tatiana Dema|Tanya]] when [[Theodore Kireev|Theo]] is asleep. Will see if reddit has anything to offer.

- 08:41 Yesterday met with [[Matias Tucci]] a frontend engineer from Readwise. He decided to stay in NYC for a couple of weeks before going to the offsite in Santa Fe.

  Very cool to see that lifestyle happen in real life. I've only heard about it before, but he is living it. Seems fun.

  He is a nice guy overall. I have a feeling that all people at Readwise are like that. Fun, passionate, kind an understanding. Very excited to slowly get into things and meet each one of them, at the next offsite, perhaps.

  Getting my new, top of the line macbook today. Excited for that too. Will start setting it up properly today. Will take notes and do proper automation for the future. Awesome, since there is no rush.

- In other news. Tanya's parent might be staying in Brazil for another year... That means that they might have made out plans for the next may for us, in a good way. I can imagine us getting rid of majority of our things and getting on an adventure starting with Brazil, then somewhere in Europe. Fun! Will see how it goes.

- 08:38 The fact that [[Tatiana Dema|Tanya]] sleeps so much and is always tired when wakes up annoys me, a lot. And the fact that she doesn't want to hear anything about it annoys me even more.

  Because of that I put [[Theodore Kireev|Theo]] to sleep a little earlier than I should have. I just got a little tired playing with him. And if Tanya could wake up and play with him for 20 minutes would be wonderful. Afterall, I do help her during the day.

  The worst thing is that regardless of when I put Theo to sleep, she also continues to sleep. But when Theo wakes up she feeds him and then he is back to me, while she brushes her teeth, prepares breakfast, etc... Annoying.

  I feel bad for putting Theo to sleep a little earlier than I should have. He is not very tired right now. Oh, he did just fall asleep, haha.

- 08:34 Missed a few days. But not to worry, let's pick that right back up.

- Spent a good evening with Tanya yesterday. Watched an episode of [[Lupin]] , then she started doing lego and I started reading [[Meditations]]. Also did a journal entry in a physical book, which I haven't done in a while. I think it is a good practice to do before sleep. It just makes sense that it will be interesting to read in the future.

 - While going over my belonging on the weekend to see what can be thrown out, I found a letter I wrote to myself and have instructed to be opened on my birthday in 2026. This made me think that maybe I should write another one, to be opened in five years.

   I think my current self can consciously expect a few good thing to happen to me in the future. I have good goals and goo motivation for those goals.

   Maybe that's still an idea for a small side project. Letter to Future Self.

- 10:13 Today's morning us better than yesterday's, that's for sure. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I went to bed around 9pm.

- After Theo went to sleep I decided to try deploying ollama to my hetzner server, as I was thinking about it a bunch. Turned out to be very simple. The only problem is that only cpu option can't handle larger requests and just times out :( So will have to stick with the local option for now. Still was fun to try it out.

- 09:30 Just meditated. Just read a chapter on [[Focus]] from the [[sources/Readwise/Pragmatic Thinking and Learning|Pragmatic Thinking and Learning]] book. Kind of got convinced to give it a try again. I mean, it's just 10 minutes of your time for a potentially high upside in productivity and focus. Don't see a reason not to try it.

  In fact, looking at this through a ROI lens feels like it will increase the chance of sticking with the habit. Instead of meditating for meditation's sake, I meditate to increase my mental clarity and focus which will help me perform better in my tasks for which I have a limited time to do.

- Yesterday we did a Gender Reveal party for [[Aram Stepanyan]] and [[Dasha Stepanyan]]. They (as well as I) found out that they will have a girl. Exciting stuff. I'm sure having a girl is very different from having a boy. I would also like to have a daughter. Ideally, boy, boy girl. But schhhh, don't tell [[Tatiana Dema|Tanya]], she only wants two.

- This morning [[Tatiana Dema|Tanya]] woke up with [[Theodore Kireev|Theo]] and started her morning with him, letting me sleep a little longer. I woke up at 8, from sounds of Theo's dissatisfaction with something. Turned out it was the lack of speed at which Tanya fed him his morning porridge.

  It felt good to sleep alone even for a little bit. Sometimes Theo can get exhausting. Spending 2-3 hours with him every single morning from 6-9 can be exhausting. It is in fact so exhausting that I had to repeat that word 3 times. So, the fact that Tanya did that this morning meant a lot. I feel a lot more energetic and positive about the day. Hope she does it more often. I just need to ask her to do that more often.

- 16:51 [[Tatiana Dema|Tanya]] is walking with [[Theodore Kireev|Theo]] right now. For some reason, I can't find something to do. I have already done some work. I have already worked on a side project for a bit. I even played a bit of spider man. I don't know what to do.

  Also, I realized while working on the side project that I might be feeling up my time with not urgent task. That comes back to the thought that if you are not working on something that you came up with at that time, it is probably wrong thing to do. I need to allocate some time to think about the things that are the most important to spend time on.

	- Installed pgvector on all the projects and in local db.
	  Spent way too much time trying to create my own docker image. Probably will need to be done at some point but is ok for now, since creator of pgvector decided to make v15 the default which is what I'm using. Very annoying that I had to spent so much time playing around with Github Actions to get it to work and in the didn't. Wish I realized that in the beginning.

- 08:54 Have been listening to [[The Iced Coffee Hour]] podcast with [[ Patrick Bet-David]]. Very inspiring and motivating. Talked a lot about raising contentious kids. I agreed with a lot of things. This cam in at the right time, as Theo has been acting very weird lately at night. He has been screaming a lot demanding to be picked up. Literally, the second you pick him up, he calms down. We don't pick him up mostly, but still this behavior is not going away resulting in very tired parents.

  The weird thing is that he is not the same during the day. He is kind smiling and not demanding at all. He is a wonderful kid, with great focus, great determination.

  Still though after listening to that podcast I started thinking... I really don't want to spoil my kid. I want him to grow up a good and kind human being. I should probably have that conversation with Tanya at some point. We need to figure out what good means in our books. Then we need to set up a plan and follow it.

- 09:12 I'd like to do my favorite exercise. Let's list of the things that are on my plate, so that I can figure out what is it that I need to spend time on for the most effect.

  - Readwise!!!
  - Built with Django
	  - Site Features
	  - Blog
	  - Twitter
	  - Newsletter
	  - Job Board
	  - Podcast
  - LevReview
	  - Marketing: Reaching out to people. Saw a great tweet that gave me an idea on how to do that. https://twitter.com/codyschneiderxx/status/1720862223877214704
	  - Ask Jonathan Zacks advice on this.
  - Get Talent Leads
	  - Marketing. Reply to all the people that responded to my cold email attempt.
	  - Figure out if there is a need for this. If not, then can I somehow pivot.
	  - Features: add vector db fields and implement semantic searching.
  - Get TJ Alerts
	  - Coding: Semantic Search, Multiple Alerts, Custom Filters Alerts, etc.
	  - Marketing: Start reaching out to people looking for jobs, after I come up with paid features.
  - Personal
	  - Brand
		  - Coding Tutorial on Youtube (can also fall under Built with Django).
		  - More written content on my personal website.
		  - Maybe start a podcast to simplify reach out to people.
	  - Development
		  - Reading
		  - Gym

  That's a lot of things. I wonder how can I better decide on what is worth my time the most?... Not to forget other responsibilities at home:
	  - Cooking Dinners.
	  - Spending time with Theo in the mornings.
	  - Spending time with Tanya in the evenings.

- Another thing we can discuss with Tanya is what we spend our time on. Is there anything that we can eliminate from our life such that it becomes easier? For example, if I'm walking with Theo, what does she spend those 1.5 hours on? Is there anything we can remove? Basically, I would encourage her to do a similar exercise on all activities she is taking and hopes to be taking.

- Today, Theo finally did let us sleep, so I feel energized. I woke up with him around 6:30am today. So spent a good 2hr+ block with him today.

  Tags: [[Sleep]]

- Was listening to [[The Iced Coffee Hour]] podcast interview with [[Tai Lopez]]. I did like it. Tai was an important figure in my life. I know most people call him a scam artists and assign a lot of negative values to him, but the reality of things is that he changed me for the better. Thanks to his content I was motivated to start reading and it actually worked. Ever since my reading habit has gotten great and I have read a ton of great books. And will read in the future.

  Tags: [[Reading]], [[Life Changing]], [[Mentor]], [[Guru]]

- One thing that stands out to me and I remember well from the podcast is about education. Nowadays schools are focused on teaching kids liberal ideas. This is wrong. Kids are more liberal by their nature, there is no need to teach them that. What kids need is a little education on some traditional ideas. Older people are the ones who need to be taught some liberal ideas, because they tend to be more traditionalist.

- 15:03 Having issue today. I'm [[Greg]]ging today (this week). As part of that title one has to triage all the error as well as fixing some of them.

  Well, i was getting better and better at triaging error and recognizng them, so that part was sort of okay. Although it does feel stressful to constantly keep up with them.

  The issue is that (1) I am not able to replicate any errors and (2) mobile setup takes forever (so many issues with logging in logging out, very unstable).

  Those issues make me feel extremely uneasy. [[Impostor Syndrome]] is hitting hard!

  I need to ask someone to help, but I don't want to disturb anyone and i don't want to seem unknowledgable.

  Part of me thinks that I just need to get done with this week... But that's bad. I need to learn as much as I can from this first week of Gregging simply because soon I will have to do it again.

  15:35 Even better idea. maybe I should ask the next Greg to ping me when he starts to replicate and fix an error (especially mobile) just so that I can learn through osmosis a bit.

I've been coming up with a lot of project ideas lately. Not enough time to bring them to life. Just want to list some of the things that I really wanted to start working on.

- [[Browser Extensions]] that tells the user how likely is it that the text on any given page has been written by AI
- Weekly newsletter that tells users about the trending [[ETF]]s
	- started a django project for this as the regular [[Python]] project was giving me headaches on how to use with a DB. [[Django]] is awesome.
- [[Telegram bot]] that checks the prices on various [[Marketplace]]s for you.
	- expensive due to the use of the proxy api, but still some potential.

  Big news. Last week [[Michael Lynch]] published a post announcing that he is selling [[isitketo.org]]. His minimum price offer was $1k, I offered $2k. Also I spoke from the heart for the reasons I wanted to buy isitketo.

  Yesterday, he emailed me saying that I'm his top pick, asking if I'm still ready to move forward. I replied that we are all good to go.

  I'm nervous. This is yet another responsibility I'm taking on. However, at the same time, this is definitely a great investment! Not only will I break even in a year or two, nothing changes, I get valuable assets, such as the domain name, content, traffic and all the other goodies.

  There is a lot of potential here. Since this will be a relatively low tech project, I will definitely have to focus on marketing. Getting out of my [[Comfort Zone]]. Maybe I can actually ask [[Tatiana Dema|Tanya]] for some help.

  Will think more about this after it all goes through.

  I'm increasingly worried about not spending enough time on money earning activities. That includes time spent developing for readwise and time spent on side projects.

  At the same time, it should be noted that as of today, it seems (according to [[Tristan Homsi]] that my performance is good). 'Good' is probably the lowest I want to go for. It is not like Readwise is offering a career ladder where I need to compete against other programmers, so there is not real insentive to go above and beyond. However, that said, I do want to do very well here. I love this company.

  Maybe, I'm just partially tired, feeling like I'm spending a little too much time with Theo. Though, is there really such a thing as spending too much time with your new born?... This time goes by quickly and usually people regret not spending enough time, not the other way round. So I should be good on that front too.

  Last is my side projects. I can split that category into 2. Projects for fun and projects for direct profit. The former are my personal website, personal newsletter. Though growth on that front would be good for profit long term, it is not focuses on earning money. You could add [[Built with Django]] there too. These projects don't take too much time, but it would be better to spend just a bit more time on writing for them.

  The latter are projects like [[Tech Job Alerts]], [[Talent Leads]] and [[IsItKeto]]. Those I don't spend much time on, probs cause they failed to prove profitability (the first too). [[IsItKeto]] has yet to prove itself as a profitable investment once I am able to display ads 🤞. Once that works I can leave it as is, for a bit. Then decide what to do next.

  That leaves me with developing new products... I do have a few ideas, so show up in my head more often then others. I'm not sure if those ideas are potentially high earners, but given my limited time I should probs mostly focus on the ones that would be able to earn me some cash.

  Actually, I had a good spreadsheet on Google to keep track of all my project ideas. I need to revive this. Ah, I dislike the fact that I moved everything to my synology... I need to start bringing it back. Centralizing all my efforts would be good for efficiency.

  Jesus, waht a relevation from using AI, yet again. Lost my access to my Synology NAS and wasn't able to open the spreadsheet I created in office. Was wondering how to use migrate it to Google Sheets for while now. Upon opening realized that is a pretty well formnatted file similar to json. Decided I should write a script with python to convert. When I asked AI to do this I forgot to specify that I need a python script (accidentally) and it just converted it for me into a csv...

  Just for the fun of it, I decided to also ask it to write a pyhon script, but it wasn't working since the file wasn't perfectly formatted. so just asking it was much faster than asking for the code 🤯

  I feel like i need to vent a little. I've been getting really tired lately of juggling [[Theodore Kireev|Theo]], work and side projects.

  Of course, most of me wants to blame [[Tatiana Dema|Tanya]], but that is defeintely no the thing to do. This is no ones fault, it is just what it is. An almost 2 year old toddler is tiring. Instead of blaming, the best way to move forward is to plan and organize everything such that everything can be done (it at all possible).

  Let's think about constraints. I have to spend ~6-8 hours for work daily. Not because that required or a standard for working, but becuase I'm still in the phase (even after a full year of working at Readwise) where it takes me time to figure out how to do a task.

  Ideally spending ~2 hours a day on side projects to move them forward and make sure that they are not in a trouble state.

  Spending the morning with Theo so that Tanya can catch up on her zzzzz, would be ideal. That's around 6-9/10 am, so ~3-4 hours. That totals to anywhere from ~11 hours to ~14 hours. given that I wake up with Theo at 6am and ideally go to bed at around 10pm that gives me 16 hours.

  That lives me with 2 hours of leisure and other unplanned activities. That is way too small, not becasue this is not enough rest, but because if there is even a slight mishap, such as Tanya's haircut, or a meeting with a friend, then the whole thing is ruined.

  So, one solution is to ask Tanya to plan her personal activities on the weekend, when I can fully give myself to Theo.

  Another thing that we are considering (even decided already) is to use day care some of the days.

  Maybe I'll get some other creative solution later on. Maybe discuss with my SO.

- 11:46
  Another useful ting here would be to better plan my day. Let's do just that. Let's start with work, since is by far the largest chunk of my day.

  Here are some some things that are on my plate:
  - make sure Medium import retry works as intended
  - Send to Kindle document image optimization
  - Learn about new integrations (Libby, Heptabase, Twitter)
  - Notion API, test the new exporting approach
  - Notion API handle modified schema
  - Backfill MECE State Transitions
  - Event deletions
  - ...

  Ok, this is getting a little out of hand... Yes, there is a lot of things on my plate.

  Probably need to use a specific tool for this, such as [[Todoist]]. But, first let's focus on things that are almost complete, those should be the first that are off my list:

  - medium
  - send to kindle
  - notion api parsing improvements

  I'll spend today before the dev meeting on those. Let's plan the next things after I'm done with those.

- 21:42 I feel bad for saying this, but I've been feeling a little unenthusiastic about my recent work at Readwise.

  It's nothing major, but this constant battle fixing integration, where each thing that happens is something new has been tiring. Each small issue that would have taken someone a few seconds to fix, takes me considerably more.

  Plus, the only one who is knowledgable here is Tristan, and we are in different timezones, which means, I've got to wait til the evening to ask him questions if any.

  Plus, it is this MECE stuff. It's not boring, per se, it actually quite coo if you think about it. But the fear of getting something wrong has been getting to me lately. I started noticing that I'm not eager to jump in and work on it, maybe cause I'm expecting failure.

  Hard to say. Of course, the work on integrations has been great for getting to know the database and improving my own DX. This will set me up to do bigger work in the Readwise codebase later on. Plus, the knowledge I get that I can leverage in other projects is great!

  All in all, I'm still happy with my job, with my situation, it's just that the latest stuff I worked on had put me down a bit. Just a tiny bit.

- 11:47 A lot of thoughts lately...

  - Having way more fights with Tanya
    Not sure what the cause is... But I know that I get easily annoyed at her, she gets easily annoyed at me. I find her useless and lazy. She finds me annoying, aggressive and whining.

  - Feeling like all that work on side projects is wasted an doesn't lead anywhere
  - Feel like failing at work
  - Feel annoyed at Theo sometimes
  - Nothing to look for in life for some reason
  - Can't really share this with my wife, since she says I wine all the time and just gets annoyed at that

	- Hacked on [[SEO Blog Bot]] a little yesterday. I think I have a good product thus far and good UI, more or less. Now I just need to do 2 main features:
	  - Write the actual content.
	  - Allow users to suggest topics to write about.

## Journal
- 08:16 Sitting on the plane for the Barcelona Amsterdam flight. Thus my travel experience has been superb, Little delays, nice stuff. Not sure if it the standard here, or just that I'm lucky.

  Unfortunately I've been doing those journal entries much less frequently. This saddens me becuase so many of positive emotions have been missed and might be forgotten in time.

  The first thing I want to mention is my son of course. I am amazed at how quickly he grows and develops. One days he is just making the "mmmmm" sound and another he is still making that sound but can already reply "da" to most of my questions. How gently and lovingly he says "mama" and "papa".

  Yes, he wakes up early. Yes, he is very demanding in amount of activities he wants to do. Yes, it is sometimes hard to keep up. But all of this doesn't matter as long he is so active and curious. I want to keep this curiosity in him for as long as possible.}

13:16

Proposed schedule for Theo
	- 6:00 am wake up
	- 7:00 - 7:30 breakfast (only main breakfast, no fruit)
	- 8:30 daycare
	- 9:30 morning snack (berries and yoghurt)
	- 11:15 - 11:30 lunch (something that can be easily eaten, kotletki/nuggets + veggies like pepper, egg)
	- 12:30 nap time right after daycare
	- 2pm afternoon snack after nap (berries and youghurt)
	- 2:10pm go for a walk right after snack.
	- 5pm dinner (together!)
	- 5:30-6:30 active play time
	- 6:30 transition to calm. lower lights, quite play, no screens
	- 7:30 start the routine: bath, teeth, pajamas, books, songs
	- 8pm in bed with the last kiss

Detailed night bed time routine starting at 7pm:
	- Pre-Bedtime Wind Down (15-20 mins before routine):
		- Dim the lights
		- Turn off screens
		- Quiet play
		- No exciting activities
	- Bedtime Routine Sequence (20-30 mins total):
		a) Start with bathroom activities:
			- Diaper change/toilet
			- Brush teeth
			- Quick bath (if part of routine)
		b) Move to bedroom:
			- Change into pajamas
			- Keep lights low
		c) Quiet connection time:
			- Read 1-2 short books
			- Sing 1-2 quiet songs
			- Brief cuddle
		d) Final Steps:
			- White noise on
			- Room darkened
			- Brief goodnight phrase ("I love you, time for sleep")
			- Place in bed while still awake
			- Leave room

Notes on the night time routine:
	- Avoid getting into bed with child
	- Don't stay until asleep
	- Keep interactions brief after "goodnight"
	- No Multiple "last" hugs/kisses
	- Negotiating "one more" anything
	- Avoid too much water before bedtime
	- Avoid fruit before bedtime

Notes on adjustment period:
	- The "Silent Return" Method:
		- Stay completely calm and neutral (poker face)
		- Say nothing or use only one short phrase like "it's bedtime"
		- Pick up and Return child to bed
		- Repeat as many times as necessary
		- Be prepared to do this 20-100 times the first few nights
		- No door locking
	- Key Points:
		- Any interaction (positive or negative) can reinforce the behavior
		- Even saying "stop" or "no" counts as attention
		- The more boring and robotic you are, the better
		- Consistency is crucial - don't give up after 30 minutes
	- If Screaming Escalates:
		- Continue the silent return
		- Avoid eye contact
		- Don't negotiate or reason
		- Don't show frustration (even though you're feeling it)
		- Remember: attention (even negative) reinforces behavior
	- If he exits the room and starts turning all the lights do the following:
		- Turn lights back off without saying anything
		- Return child to room silently
		- Place back in bed
		- Leave room
		- Repeat as many times as needed

Notes on day time Nap Routine Sequence (10 mins):
    a) Prepare Environment:
		- Close curtains
		- White noise on
		- Room temperature check
	b) Quick Quiet Time:
		- Change into comfortable clothes if needed
		- 1 short book
		- Brief cuddle
	c) Final Steps:
		- Brief phrase ("time for nap" or "sleep well")
		- Place in bed awake
		- Leave room
	Key Points:
		- Keep it shorter than bedtime routine
		- Same sequence daily
		- Avoid getting too drowsy during routine
		- Leave room while still awake
	If Resistance:
		- Use same "silent return" method as night
		- Stay consistent with approach
		- No engagement during protests
		- Return to bed calmly and quietly
		- If resistance happens for longer than 60 mins, abandon the nap attempt. try again tomorrow. other than that all the same.
	Important Notes:
		- Don't let nap start later than 1:00 PM
		- Wake after 1.5-2 hours if sleeping longer
		- Keep routine boring and predictable
		- No screens before nap
		- Avoid getting into bed with child

Expected Progress:
	- First 3-4 nights usually worst
	- Noticeable improvement within a week
	- Significant improvement in 2 weeks
	- Full adaptation in 3-4 weeks
	- Both parents must follow exactly the same approach
	- Progress isn't linear (might get worse before better)

Signs the plan is working:
	- Falls asleep within 30 mins of bedtime
	- Stays in bed through the night
	- Wakes at appropriate time
	- Takes consistent naps
	- Improved mood during day

- Personal
	- requested to be added on a bunch of starter packs
	- decided to start a separate dir here to keep my finding on different 'hidden' apis. But quickly realised this is useless. Since, I was able to find them, there is no reason i won't be able to do so in the future. So, this is likely a wasted work. I was looking at boardgamegeek, and there are a lot of open endpoints!

- 12:50 I think keeping logs (such as this one) is very useful, however... Today, (in the beginning of the year, when I have the most motivation to try new things) I basically logging each small thing which makes it a little distracting. Though that is not completely fare, since I am doing a bunch of things today after a long break.

- 12:39 Yesterday started of great, but then turned crappy :( Don't want to get into details, but it is a stupid fight about a game and... I really don't want to get into it. The point is that due to my impulsiveness and agressivenes/explosiveness, I have ruined the day for myself and others...

  Before going to bed we made up, but the aftertaste was there, at least for me.

  I just have this weight on my shoulders that is not letting me relax :(

- 14:47 Just goes to show that I keep getting distracted, which is my own fault half of the time. This time Theo woke up and didn't let me finish this writing sessions.

  We were talking about weight on my shoulders. It is tiring.
  - Work that is currently difficult and requires much more time than I would hope for
  - Theo is very time consuming
  - Since it is a holiday season all the holiday preparations and all the time we spend with the family
  - I feel like Tanya is not being super useful lately, much more of a downer... I'm sorry to say this, but I constantly feel like I do too much... I'm probably unfair, but i'm just too tired and too under the pressure to care to be honest. If you are reading this. I'm sorry
  - Side projects that I keep thinking about but can't do anything about because I don't want to (i'm tired) and just don't have the time for
  - Green Card application. Stupid paper work, but even stupider is the fact that I'm not sure we even want that... Are we going back to the US?
  - All the posts I want to write, book reviews, built with django content
  - All the books I want to read
  - All the games I want to play in the hope that they will relax me and prepare me for good work.


  I'm just tired. And then whatever I do, I always think about work, like I'm not doing enough. Because that's true. There is always something/someone distracting me from work (personal or otherwise). And I can't really tell this to anyone. Tanya will get angry, anyone else will just blame someone else, etc.

  I don't know what to do to be honest. I guess my regular exercise of things I'm currently doing and are on my mind would be helpful...

  Then again, after I do that, what then? If I'm working I'll b be thinking of not spending enough time with my family. If I'm spending time with my family I'll be thinking about projects and work. It is tiring.

  One would think, oh, after Theo's birthday Aida leaves, no more prep for celebrations. But then it is Tanya's birthday and I have to get her a gift.

  Sometimes I wish I didn't have to do anything. I'm just so tired, I need a fucking break... And it is not coming any time soon. What do I do? Fuck...

  Ok, let's do that exercise:
  - Work
	  - Monitor Notion Upgrade Errors and try to fix anything that is easy to fix.
	  - Write in Notin Devs about the Knoweldge Hub One
	  - Tasks from the Dev Planning
	  - Try to address issues from CX team

- 14:36 Continuing Exercise from yesterday...
	- Work
		- Deal with Notion Integration Migration
		- Tasks from the Dev Planning (integration stuff)
		- Try to address issues from CX team
	- Personal
		- Do Year in Review (plus plans for 2025)
		- Think through the state of current projects
		- Start thinking about new projects
		- Blog Posts
	- Family
		- Get a gift for Tanya's birthday
		- Theo's day care
		- Theo's potty training

- Yeah, I think I'm almost at a point that I might have had enough games. In fact I feel much better today than I did yesterday, however not much changed. This suggests to me that this downer state was not a real thing but a momentary lapse... Who knows...

  All I know now is that I just have to Sunday and start planning our life a little more stricter. But then again, the second I start to think about this I get stressed. Cause I know I won't have time for this. Between stressful thoughts about work (that I'm not doing enough, cause I have literally done nothing this week, and it doesn't look it will change on Monday), thinking about all the planning ahead I'm just getting stressed. Fuck...

  I just have so much in my head, so many things I want to do that it becomes stress inducing to realize I have no idea what to do in any given moment. Or perhaps, I do know, just that I don't want to do that specific thing and do something else.

  I want to spend some time on a new project called where to share. I want to try integrating React in to Django templates. I want to spend more time on my existing projects, but I just can not... This makes me sad.

- 12:27 I'm so tired. And not in the sleep sense, but in the attention sense. Tanya woke up with Theo today at 6:20 and let me sleep til about 9. Then I woke up and started playing with Theo, up until 10:40. I put him to sleep, woke up Tanya. Started doing my coffee, wasting time in Youtube Shorts... Then Tanya woke up, then made a cheese sandwich. Then, went to work. Or rather just sit at computer for some time, researching cool staff, following y curiosity... The second I sat down, Theo woke up... Then I spent a little time with him while Tanya was in bathroom. Then I sat down at around 12pm, still 0 work done. Now, ask me if I want to start working straight away... No, I don't. I don't want to. I just so tired of this. Every fucking morning is the same 😭

  Then Theo is going to come knocking on my door screaming to play with him. Then I will have to use the bathroom and he will immesiatly here me and run towards me not letting me pee or go bakcto my room to work. Then will be dinner and he is not going to let me go bnack. then we go to put him to bed. then i'm fucking tired, but still hav to go to work, cause I didn't get a chance to work before. I'm writing this and tears are rolling up in my eyes. I'm just so tired, playing catch up with life.

  I have som much freedom, workiing for a great company with great peopl, have such a wonderful family, wonderful wife an sone, work from home, but yet I feel like there is no. breathing room to do anything else but work and spend time wioth fauily. I bearly get any sleep, any work done on side projects.

- 16:51 this is officially the worst working day of my life. I'm stuck on a stupid little problem!

- 11:55 Hello, hello. It finally happened. I'm alone at home in [[Chigasovo]], while [[Theodore Kireev|Theo]] is sleeping and Tanya with Mom are at Yoga. I have some time to think. Give me a moment. I just remembered that I wanted to look up some potential func events for my mom, will be back in a minute.

  Alright I'm back. Let's do some thinking... I was waiting for this for a good while. Don't even know where to start. Ok, first think I want to right down are the things I want/need to do:
  - Finish prep for Green card application
  - a bunch of work. hopefully this week is more productive for me
  - work on a project that will finally start bringing in some revenue! will do some more writing on this later
  - normalize my sleep!
  - exercise
  - finish my annual review post

- ok, so, business. let's say that I was able to catch up and normalize work stuff. now i have some extra time for my projects. what are the steps I can take to maximize my chances of making some revenue?

  well, first of all I already have a few projects running fine. spending time on those means not spending time creating a project and thus can achieve results closer. plus, these are not random projects, but something i thought can be profitable at the time i was writing about it. I think for all of them, i should come up with a one-time payment, life time deal for the next 100 customers to make it easier to understand whether the product is viable. Thanks to [[johnrush.me]] for the idea.

  then, as unfortunate as it is, spend some time on marketing... I was thinking not long ago, how good would it be to find someone that I could partner with who has a much better business/marketing accument than me. Like, tristan and dan, like guys at plausible, like guys at fathom, etc. someone to complement my skills. not sure what is the best way to find those... be active on social media?

  anyway, while I don't have such a partner, doing it myself is important. i think the next best thing I can do is to figure out how to be more vocal about my projects on social media. X, Youtube, Bluesky, newsletter?...

  cool thing that I have a project running to help me with writing articles. should definitely leverage this more often. In fact, this is probably, one thing i should start with. post on my projects with SEOBlogBot, more often. Then, share progress on my projects on X. Also record Django tutorials for Youtube to gather more eyes, promote projects and help people.

  one thing i struggle with when trying to be vocal on social media is my colleagues or rather my boss thinking that I'm slacking on work in favor of personal projects. Truthfully, I know this is bullshit, and something that my stupid brain came up with as an excude to not do this. The truth is it is just scary to put yourself out there and potentially. fail. this is definitely something I want to work on in 2025.

  here are projects that I have that are running fine with minimal inteference from me:
  - seoblogbot
  - tjalerts
  - talentleads
  - builtwithdjango
  - levreview
  - osig
  - statushen
  - isitketo

  Damn, this is a nice and impressive list. I think that SEO Blog bot has good chances to be profitable and just needs to be marketed correctly.

  I think Built with Django has good chances to be a good low effort project that can bring in some income. I just need to get some addtional traffic. I can then start selling ad spots on the newsletter and via something like ethicalads.

  I always felt like Talent Leads has good potential, but I don't think I want to spend much time on it. Though I definitely will be keeping it alive with TJ Alerts and start posting blog posts on it via SEO Blog bot.

  LevReview is just on a massive pause. Maaaaaaaybe, I could try to make it work on the Russian market, but I have to grow a pair and start asking stores if they want this.

  I kind of got disappointed on StatusHen... It didn't take me too long to build, but I think my execution on it was not perfect and as a result this might be too complex for the potential user. Though of course I will keep it alive, since I use it in my projects and will start posting on it too.

  Is it keto... This one is a mistery to me... Should I do more work on it or leave as is?... Maybe adding more ads, adding recipes and continue adding products is the way to go. Need to spend more strategic thinking on it, especially with the knowledge that most people that use it are on mobile. Maybe make a mobile app? Ooooooooh, I like that idea! Good learning opportunity!

  Osig. I'm not sure this is a great app for earning money. Though, bannerbear did it somehow, maybe learn more about bannerbear doing it. maybe even reach out to [[sources/Readwise/Tweets From Jon Yongfook|Tweets From Jon Yongfook | Jon Yongfook]]. Afterall, I did craete it since I couldn't find a nice solution to replace ogi.sh... So that's fine. Plus I improved my cookiecutter a lot.

  Ok, that's all of them. Good list, good thoughts. One last think I want to mention is that there has been another project idea on my mind for a long time and keeps popping up in my head. wheretoshare.com or something like that. basically an automattic way of submitting my site to various directories. I think it wouldn't take me too long to build it, it has great earning potential, it can help me a ton with all my other projects and it would be a great AI usecase. checks most of the boxes. Now just need to figure out when to build it, where to get the time. thankfully from my thoughts above I would say I have the capacity. most of the projects will just require creating seoblogbot posts on them and not much else. SEO Blog bot will require some marketingm but other than that not much else, not much programming.

  So if i consider spending more time consistenttly on creating and sharing posts on my projects, marketing seoblogbot, sharing stuff on social media adn perhaps recording tutorials, then there should be some time left for me to work on that new project. theoretically. just need to get my life in order.

- 10:57 Made a very poor choice last night. When we were back at the apartment at ~21:40 instead of going to bas i decided to offer tanya a bottle of Prosecco and  something to watch and thus ended up going to bed at around 00:00, with a phone... Stupid, stupid me.

  Now as a result I'm super tired, but have a ton of work to complete. So, no time for other stuff :( Well, I guess i wouldn't have time for that either way, since Tanya overtook Theo only around 10-10:30, but at least I would be faster and more efficient. Now? Not so much.

  We are the choices we make!

- 08:39 went to bed much earlier yesterday. around 9pm. read for a bit about [[Alexander the Great]] and fell asleep. Very quick. Given that Theo woke up around 5:50, I had about 8-9 hours of sleep, yet I still struggled to wake up. Either is just human nature to struggle waking up or, i have a sleep deficit that needs to be restored. If the latter, I bet the way to go here is not to do it in one sitting of sleeping 14 hours, but doing the same thing as yesterday, few weeks straight. Yes, it sucks a bit that I have to wake up - play with theo - work - sleep. but that is the price to pay for being a careless prick who doesn't sleep.

  also, my physical appearance is disappointing me. or, rather, my lack of discipline is saddening me. We had a great dinner last night, but I felt the need to walk to the nearest supermarket and buy some junk food, and nothing stopped me. I ate a bit of ice cream last night... for what? i mean, it was alright, not even great. do i want to sacrifice my health for something alright? something tells me no...

  Readwise announced that we are going to Tuscany Italy early april. Tanya's reaction of anger/saddness disappointed me. her position on being the victim is making me sad a lot of the time... Although I am trying to figure out what to do here... if it is a possibility of going together, either before or after the readwise trip. need to decide fast since the visa process takes some time. today I will need to consult with my sister and my mom on whether they will be able to babysit for a week. I will also have to consult in the company if that is something we are ok doing. i'm guessing doing it after is the way to go? from 11th-17th? that is a small amount of time unfortunately.  Seems doable. Nervous.

  I think there was something else I wanted to write about. Ah, yes, the Green Card Application is over my head. Need to complete this today. Maybe I'll get to that now.
  - Sign the paperwork
  - Call MMC for work history

- 12:52 Posted v1 of the annual review. Obvously I left out a lot of stuff. Plus winged the structure. Turned out to be more of an essay than an annual review. Will also complete 2025 Goals in the next couple of days and hopefully keep it much more structured with bullet points, such that I can complete next year's 2025 annual review much simpler.

  Getting data from all the projects. This gave me a good idea on blog post ideas for all my projects in 2025. Work craetes more work, in a good way (nice quote 🤣)

  Somewhat tired by the end of this exercise. It took some of my time that could have spent on other things. Though I think it was still worth it, since it gave me a lot of ideas for what to do in 2025 and how to do it. we'll see.

12:45 - I will be so stupid if I don't take action and leverage the usefulness of AI now. It's not about the hype. What matters is the speed revolution. The speed with which people are able to create new products is insane. Everyone is experiencing it, meaning that the are about to be a big spike in number of Saas products. It's a race. So I need to partiipate. Just need to figure our where do I have the best chances. And focus on that.

11:51 - Okay. While I remember, I just wanted to speak this memory. Right now, Theo, my son, is in the stage of learning to, in potty training, and it's going super well. Like, he was basically doing it from day one, no issues. And I think I wrote about it a little bit, maybe not so much, but one memory that I would like to record is that one time before we officially started potty training, which was after I finished reading the book, we kind of did a few attempts without knowing the details. He was doing it sometimes, sometimes not. But then one time, like a few days before we actually wanted to start it officially, I woke up with him in the morning, and I was so tired that I basically lay down on the couch and fell asleep. And he was just playing with his toys and stuff, not for too long, but just basically allowing me to sleep a little bit. And then at some point, he comes to me and he starts, like, I don't recall exactly whether he was like smashing me on my face or not, but he was like, "Dad, dad, dad, papa, papa." And then, so I wake up, I see him, and then he's showing me that he was in a diaper, that he actually removed the diaper and peed, so he brought me the potty with the pee. And I was so impressed that, I think, instead of waiting a couple more days, we decided to start that day, actually. That was very fun. So yeah, he's doing very well in that regard. Yeah, that's it. So I guess the next thought is that about two weeks ago, I started going to bed much earlier, like 9, 9.30 p.m., reading a bit and falling asleep. And the last two weeks were very good. I felt much better when he woke up at six, plus or minus 30 minutes. But now, this week, I don't feel good, even though I keep going to bed early, 9, 9.30. I'm just so tired. I guess he will start waking up a little earlier, maybe due to potty training, maybe for some other reason, but, ugh, man, it's so hard. I don't understand how, like, even going early. Okay, okay, I guess there are things that I can improve on. Like, I was drinking a little bit of cider before the bed, so that could be a big reason. You know, probably the biggest. Lack of exercise, lack of movement, probably not a big one. So yeah, instead of saying I don't know why, I should probably say I know why and start fixing it. Yeah, okay. So, good that I decided to put that down on paper.

## Journal

- 10:23 using superwhisper to jot down project idea:
	Okay, my idea is a visual timeline, quote unquote map, historical, where I have people, events, countries, but mainly people. I want to start with people, I want to focus on people. This is very similar to the book that my wife Tana gave me for one of the celebrations, which is a visual timeline history. It's like a map/visual representation of time. So what I want to have is a Django app where we don't have to have user authentication, no payments, nothing like that. What we need is just tasks. And the database will have a person model, which will take note of things like year born, well I guess date born, date died, where if we know what the actual date is, we put that date. And if we don't know the date, we can estimate the day and the month and hopefully we get the year more or less clear. I have yet to figure out how to handle cases where the date of birth or death are unclear. They're like plus or minus 10 years. I have to figure out how to handle that. But for now let's assume that we know the years of death and birth. So we're going to have the date of birth, date of death. Then the next thing is kind of profession sort of thing. So that would be like a one thing. So like a king or an emperor or ideally I would like it to be as abstractionalized as possible. So like a ruler instead of king, emperor and so. So a ruler, a person who rules the country, then a philosopher. So basically like a profession. So one thing that describes a person the best. Then we can have like interests or hobbies field which is same as occupation slash profession but it allows us to enter multiple things like a comma separate list. So we have that. Then we have a country that that person is associated with or rather let's say country of birth where he was born. So it could be like a Roman Empire or it could be depending on the age. So the place where the person was born. So that's a field. The next field is places where the person is associated with. So for example Plutarch could be associated with both Rome and Greece. So it's also a comma separate list of countries. Ideally I think I would want this to be a foreign key at least the date or the place of birth. I want it to be a foreign key to a model called place. So that the first model we're talking about is person. Second model is place. And that could be. I feel free to play around with what the model looks like but obviously it's going to have a name. If possible it's going to have like coordinates. Latitude and longitude. Maybe separate fields. And then feel free to add anything else that matters. That could be useful in the future. And so for the place of birth that would be a foreign key. And then for the places associated with the person that would be a many to many field I think. Yeah. Okay so what else? The person. We'll have a description which is going to be a text field which will populate the AI. And also feel free to add anything else that you think is required. To the person and to the place. Oh yeah I'm going to finish it here. And say that also feel free to come up with any other models that you think that will be useful for this project idea. idea. One thing that I would like to add to the project is the note that it should be possible, in the future at least, for the user looking at the map to select two people who lived in the same time. So click, click, both two are selected. I start with both two. And that would bring up a screen which would show if those two people had any interactions. Any known interactions. And if people selected two different people in different times, then this could mean instead of having actual physical contact between the two, we would see if maybe either two wrote any books or articles or anything like that that mentioned that other person. So basically allowing users to select two people, different time, same time, that and it would bring up a screen where it would say of any interaction between two people, whether physical or literal or any other.

- 12:39 another whisperai note:
	Hello, hello. Yeah, right now, so as I'm debugging another issue for reader, readerwise, to be more specific, the Kindle export and coming up with a script and yada yada yada. It's not the most kind of sexy work and not the work that I like doing the most, like, you know, developing new features and just improving stuff. But, you know, debugging, figuring out what's going on, why users are not happy and why they are not getting what they are expecting. It's not the best, not the most amazing work, but I'm thinking that, you know, while I'm doing it, I should be getting some sort of skill improvement. In the future, I know that most of the work is this, is this type of work, or figuring out what's going wrong as opposed to writing something new. So, just kind of as a reminder to myself that even though it's not the most amazing, not the most exciting, or the stuff that I like doing the most, it's definitely the most useful in terms of career, probably. Having the ability to quickly debug and figure out what's going on and fix it is very important, because most of the work of a programmer is actually maintaining code. Just as a reminder to myself. That's it.

## Journal

- 10:22 - Currently enjoying book How to Get Rich by [[Felix Dennis]]. Recommended by [[Andrew Wilkinson]]

- 11:16 In regards to the app ideas on summarizing books.
	- Of course that is not the point of reading books, just to summarize them. A lot of context is lost, lot of persuasion from the author.
	  When we read we internalise the point, as we go along it gets deeper into us, ingraining in our brains. So you can't just summarize your way to success.
	- In defence of this idea, summarizing can definitely help you to figure out if you want to read the book. This is especially useful for non linear book. Books where author says you can jump aroound from chapter to chapter, from page to page.

- 11:34 Each one of us has his own definition of being nice. Regardless of what that definition is, each one of us should aspire to be more of that. That said, that shouldn't be your only goal. You can't achieve all your goals just by being nice, you should develop other qualities too. Still though, more niceness would be good for the world and for you.

- 11:36 Self belief is extremely important. If you are a masculine type of person, defined like in the book [[The Way of Superior Man]], you should gian more self belief. The way to practice it is by making choices for you and for your close ones. Start with simple decisions like what movie to watch, what to eat for dinner. If you are worried about making the wrong choice that others won't like, this is exactly what needs to be solved. We want to get rid of that feeling. Genrally empathy and thinkning about other is important. But you can't confuse it with lack of decision making / procrastiantion. Healthy dose of empathy is good, but it should never affect you self belief. Have that confidence to make the chouice that you believe will benefit others and yourself. The wrold needs less procrastinators and more decision makers / doers.

- 11:59 Now that I know I have means to analyse and retrieve them later it is much more fun to actually put them down. Furthermore, with tool like SEO Blog Bot I can leverage my thoughts to create some written content.

- 12:09 The reason a lot of books recommend that you should accept risk. If you want to succeed is that you need to be ready to fail. This is a genius advice. Because once you accept that it makes it so much more easy to move, to make decisions. And that is what makes you succeed. Speed and decisiveness.

## Journal

- 08:11 Recently started reading a blog post by Jason Cohen. I don't recall what it's called, but it was basically about... I didn't even read it, I just read the summary. It was... the summary was basically, you can't have it all out of three. Work, family, and side pro... hobby. You can have only two. If you try to do three, you know, some other will get neglected. It sort of made me sad. I feel like the only way forward, the only "successful" way forward would be to do a side project that will turn into a business. Even though I'm happy with my work, happy with my salary, salary work is just never gonna make us, you know, rich enough, unfortunately.

	- shipped the seo blog bot updates (not 100% happy). I feel like the quality of responses has fallen. will need to fix, thats not a big issue since it is just playing around with the prompt. the issue is the error hadnling with pydantic ai. for some reason anthropic model is failing validation and it is not 100 clear on how to best handle errors and retries... this definitely needs to be fixed
	- fixed sotrages for built with django

09:57 - Not sure if i mentioned this before, but CodeRabbit agreed to pay $500 for a sponsor blog post 🤯 I should def reach out to more companies like CodeRabbit... Maybe Sentry?... But besides reaching out to other companies, I think I can definitely ask CodeRabbit to renew the add next month if they are happy with traffic. Also, if they are happy with a blog post, I can do a video too... Win - win, since it might actually help me kickstart me my video journey.

- probably the worst code i ever wrote in my entire life. complex logic of doing caching is craaaaaaaazy. Thanks to Tristan for pointing it out and suggesting something more simple. honestly i don't understand how i could do this.... once i started i couldn't be stopped.... i have to learn to stop and think for a second. sometimes the code doesn't have to be finished, i need to learn to let it goooooooooo. sunk cost fallacy.

17:15 - Sitting in a plane to Istanbul right now, on my way to meet the Readwise team in Florence. i have a lot of thoughts, conflicting thought. Opened up the laptop just now after reading Marcus Aurelius Meditations wanting to do a little bit of meditation of my own. But once i started writing immediatly thought about Tanya and Theo and the fact that I left sad today. Theo is ill, he has been for 3-4 weeks now. Leaving my son who is clearly not feeling well alone with my wife who has been having weakness symptoms more often lately is hard. I feel bad. I feel like I'm failing them, disappointing them. It sucks. I want to be the best I can for them, and for myself and for my family in general, but sometimes I get tired too. I guess if dig deep enough I'm somewhat relieved that I get a break, but this thought only makes it worse. Like I said I want to be strong, reliable and helpful for them. But I get tired too sometimes, I just try not to show it, though I don't think I'm successfull on that front either. Our fights with my wife are usually a result of me complaining of how tired i am, even though i know she is tired too. I feel like I don't say it often, so my words should carry some weight, but i guess they do not. **We all feel like our words should carry some weight, and someitmes neglect this fact and therefore don't listen to others as we ought to.**

I wanted to do a little of philosophical thinking myself. In a sense this passage above is a philosophical thought. I guess philosophy doesn't happen in a vacuum, one has to think about the things that worry him, things that are on his mind. Which is what I have done.

Another thing that I questioned mysefl on is the work i do on my projects. The passage that made me think about this goes something like this: "Our lives don't matter in the grand scheme of things. We all die and are forgotten at some point". This means one thing only, that you hsould not docus on what others think of you. You should do what you think is right. In my head the best thing to do with ones life is to make lives of people areound you as pleasant as possible. If things don't matter, it doesn't mean we shouldn't enjoy life. on the contrary that is what we should focus on.

I could argue that my side projects have one goal and one goal only. Give me the cash to make the above happen. Make lives of my family and those close to me as comfortable as possible. My kids should be able to do with their live whatever they want without thinking about money. My wife and I should focus on the things we enjoy doing in life, whatever that might be. We don't know yet, since we haven't really deidcated out lives to us yet, more to our son. Make sure my mom never has to worry about money. Build a house or a compound where my friends can hang out if they want.

I feel like this is only achievable only through side projects. Man can't earn for the above from a salaried job and enough to take care of basic needs (which can somoeimtes be enough too).

It is true that I enjoy working on things, coding. But I've been getting a little more pessimistic about this lately. I think the reason for taht is that it is hard. It is hard to make a product that people want and pay for. It is hard as it is, but is even harder to find time to work on while you have other obligations to your closest people.

It's hard. I want to spend time with my son, but sometimes it gets hard. I want to spend time with my wife, but sometimes it feels a little wasteful (wathcing movies).

14:42 - One a train ride from florence to rome to meet with my Tanya. One thing one want to ponder right now is her inability to be independent, not in a bad way per se. So, she arrived in rome last night and was under stress becuase she did not see the driver who was supposed to pick her up. so i spent an hour on the phone helping her find the car, contacting the car service and doing all the leg work, while she was on the verge of crying and stressing out. in the end the car picked her up and drove to the hotel. the next part of the adventure is that she got dorpped not right at the exit, but on the adjacent street of the hotel. she messaged me sayinf that the driver dropped her early god konws where and she doesn't know what to do... i asked her to send me her location and it turns out that she was 10 meters away from the exit. she kept crying and stressing saying that there is some sort of dead end that she doesn't know what to do. when i asked her to show me where she is on the camera she kept pointing at the floor... and yes, it was very annoying and making me somewhat angry, i tried to keep calm and help her, and she kept with her hysteria and crying, constantly disconnetcting out call... in the end it was all fine, but she was in a bad mood. as a result i missed out on the final night of argentpole and just on the general chit chat with my colleagues on the last day.

while all of this is extremely annoying and disturbing, i'm just trying to calm myself down that this is just her... she is not able to be independent and solve problems in stress situations... given that it is a week only in rome for us it certainly doesn't make sense to fight about it and i will not bring it up.

however, some lessons for me for the future. i will have to solve all our problems in the future myself. i guess i'm ok at it and it is not a problem, but i do need to streategically find something that she is good and happy about. then slowly nudge her into this line of action, without her knowing. that is not the most thankful work, becasue if i succeed, she will think that it is all her doing. that's fine. maybe **the most important work is done from the shadows**?

she did say in the past that she doesn't like spending time on her own, that she likes to spend time with me and Theo, now it sort of makes sense more. and that is fine, no problem with that. some people are not biult to do solo backpakcing and stuff like that. however, i do enjoy that, a lot. so i will need to find some time for myself to do these things. In general, i thought that it might be a make thing of doing the hard things, doing things alone and just solvng some sort of problem.

and example that came to me is Kris, who likes to go to the wilderness and stay in the woods, while his family is waiting at the final destination with a trailer setup and everything ready to enjoy the more civilized part of the trip.

i feel like i don't have to much time sometimes, but just like doing a quick dashborad while you fix a bug, it doesn't have to be a standalone project , just something i do and plan wihle going about my life. I need to think about how i could insert some adventure and some uncertainty into my life. working from home, doing babysitting, helping to go to the doctor and doing all these family things at home can be depressing at times. or rather not at time, usually in the moment it is fine, but in the long term it might have a negative consequence on my mental health. maybe even these side projects that I'm doing is a way i'm trying to cope with that... who knows.

there is not clear cut path for this right this second or a set of todos. this is something i will have to ponder on to fix this long term issue.

18:10 - Still on my way there... aweful, annoying. just becuase i sat on the wrong train, just because i read the timetable incorrectly. fuck. the good news is that I ordered some food for tanya, and that immediately made her happy. i guess she was just hungry 🤷 the most annoying thing is that even though i'm late by 4 hours, the whole day of our vacation is a basically gone. oh well, no way forward but to accept it and move on. maybe make some lessons.

09:48 - More and more often i see people talk about lack of time due to work and family. Those 2 things sure do take most of our time in our life. Thankfully i have a good job that pays well. Unfortunately, nowadays, it is still not enough to live super comfortably, not caring about anything else. The only way to achieve this is through a business. But how does one do it, if there is no time? The answer to these type of questions seems to be: hard work. That's it. That's the secret sauce. But what does that mean exactly? Those little YT Shorts interactions are so small that I can't achieve anything meaningful in that period of time. Well, if you collect all those small distractions during the day you might find that they add up to quite a bit. So chunking day into blocks can be of great help, actually. The last problem is work. I'm not very efficient there. Tasks are not super transparent, and not easy to fix. Most of the things I'm working on are debugging and figuring things out on my own, from scratch.

10:39 - lately doing work on marketing agents via semi-vibecoding and am a little worried about the bugs, especially the api ones and frontend ones. django views are simple in nature and handle a lot for you. while doing everything via api endpointa and sitmulusjs controller leaves a lot of room for errors to catch. hard to predict. would need to keep a close eye on logs and sentry errors

- 10:01 I'm slightly angry right now. I was fine when I woke up at 5am with Theo. And we spent time great together. But by 9:30 when I'm out and about with Theo it is slightly annoying that no one really wants to take him over. Annoying that I have to ask. Annoying that I can't just sit and work. Everything is crappy here. No space near desk to sit in, beds are different size and close the socket.. can't even start to describe all of it...

  wanted to go work by the pool, but something stopped me. I guess it was the fact that we had to go back and I had a call with Justin today... Now that I think about it, it's pretty silly that I'm a little angry. I guess I'll have the call now and will head out there anyway. I don't have any calls, so if the internet is sucky, no worries, will be just a good learning for the next week. will have to start using the coworking location. it is only $120 per month and taxi is $2 per ride. So should be financially viable. Can leave at any time and come back at any time...

  one more thing that is on my mind is that i have a ton of work at readwise and it is always something that is reducing my ability to produce results. if the week was a little calmer and my past weeks have been much more productive i would have been much more calm about all of this... but that is not the case unfortunately, so i just have to

10:41 - I get very sad these days that I can't spend more time on the things I want to spend time on. For example, just yesterday I was thinking ti would be cool to re-print / re-publish russian classics, maybe with some ai gened images, or with some ai annotations i make when reading. in any case, well formatted, but I don't have the time. I barely have the time for work. I'm glad that I'm now wasting a lot of time. I spend it on work, on Theo. I wish I had more time for [[Tatiana Dema|Tanya]] and for some fun projects.

it sort of is a chicken and an egg problem. to have more of that time, i need a project that will bring in money and won't take a lot of time. but to build such a project, i need time...

10:51 - sometimes it is killing me how (i don't even know what adjective to use) tanya is. one day saying that she wants to exercise and better herself, but then just sits and watches videos about buying clothes, or watching instagram. i don't know what to do about it. i don't think this is fine and will lead to hateful life in my opinion.

14:35 - I have an extreme fear of failure. Maybe in general, but in this case I'm talking about shipping code that will break something on Readwise. It is stopping me from shippping more and moving more quickly I think. I generally don't care much for my projects. But here, it is someone elses money, someone elses time....

13:44 - Playing arond with a bunch of personal stuff today... AI is insane. As you can see above I've added a Personal Slack chanell and have added a bunch of tools there. Primarliry the craziest one is Cursor. I can now ask (through slack) to do a certain feature and it will do that in the background craeting a PR... then Greptile (i have an open source license) will review this code making suggestions... what? Insane. I'm now looking to see what other things I can do with this idea... for example. can i integrate todoist into slack to list the tasks and ask ai to start working on it? just merged a pr like so. it worked. no issues. one cool thing would be if i could ask cursor to fix greptile's pr suggestion. i'm sure that will come soon.

14:49 - Found a nice workaround for the issue where container started via caprover third party apps did not runght emigrations for plausible community edition container. so i just started custom one without clickhouse and postgres. then stopping it once migration is done

14:56 - FOund a potentially cool lifehack. instead of buying and playing games with interesting plots. just watch the playthrough... no time wasted on the game, can work while wathcing.

09:51 - Thinking about the future a lot lately... If we are not pursuing life in the US any time soon, then Readwise must be my last place of employment. If we remain in russia with russian citizenship only, then no one form the us will hire me... russian salaries are a joke. even if we get brazilian citizenship, it is douobtful that use companies will hire me much. only the remote ones, but will they be able to to pay me as well as readwise does? give all this the only path forward it seems to is start getting revenue from side projects. but that seems less and less like. no matter how hard i try, no matter how much i change strategies it just doesn't work.

			1. Identify your API requests for now via the User-Agent header. For the format and information to include, we recommend following the guidelines in Wikimedia's User Agent guide: [https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Policy:Wikimedia_Foundation_User-Agent_Policy](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Policy:Wikimedia_Foundation_User-Agent_Policy)
			2. Make changes to your API requests to reduce the load on us to acceptable levels. This might be some combination of: less frequent syncs, spreading out requests, syncing at a quiet time of day. We can work with you to find the best combination of factors.
		- will introduce to engineer who will talk specifics
		- long term requests to work with us:
			1. We may request some small adjustments to your requests to make them cheaper for us to handle. We’ll ask that you implement these changes.
			2. Longer term: by a mutually agreed-upon date, we’ll need you to adopt OAuth instead of using developer tokens. This will allow us to identify requests more easily, improve security for users, and enable us to provide more efficient APIs for this use case in future.
		- need to do a business agreement with hypothesis to continue

21:20 - using a Wispr Flow more and more is pretty cool. I like the fact that I can just hold a right shift and just speak so it's always there, it's always available. I've been starting to use it for online chats, that's pretty well. I use it a couple of times in Cursor, that was nice. Now I'm using it for Obsidian Journal also nice because I have a small barrier of speaking. I guess I feel like some people hear it so they might be hearing what I'm saying what I'm hearing sometimes. I have a blog on that though. I know if I heard someone do this it would be totally fine, I have no issue with that. But for some reason, I feel like people around me will have an issue with that.

Yeah, that's nice for me, it's slowly getting me off this shyness of recording. Maybe they can start recording videos soon if I keep up. So yeah, cool thanks Wispr Flow.

23:17 - Need to start promoting myself more often. No way around that. If you are not going to do that, no one will.

- 09:15 I just read a piece of news that says Armenia and Azerbaijan are signing a peace deal, and it seems like Trump is going to be mediating this, signing, which made me think. Apparently, he's also going to make some sort of economic deals both with them separately and then there was a mention of them investing in the South Caucasus region for a better trade or something like that. I need to research this more, but that made me think. Obviously, that's a good thing, and it seems that his strategy and I've seen people talk about this online, so it's not my analysis, but basically, I'm not supposed to follow people, but it seems that his style is: where he can get a quick win, he goes in if he can do it, he does it very quickly, if not, then he just leaves it and moves on to the next meeting. That kind of makes sense from the perspective of a short 4-year period of presidency, but it reminds me of the logic that the Roman consuls had when they were in charge. I think there was one or two years, and basically, they tried to do as many battles as possible to leave their name in the history books. But at the same time, it sort of makes sense on an individual level. I'm thinking that for the betterment of the whole world as opposed to one individual self, it makes sense to focus on the long-term stuff - like building a building that takes 100 years to build because you know it's such a huge project and you started it, and maybe when it's finished, you won't be remembered for starting it, but the work you laid there brought something beautiful. The example is bad because I'm comparing peace vs. building beautiful buildings, but I think it can be applied to political issues too, though I'm not sure how.

- 12:10 pretty cool that I'm making this recording with Wispr Flow, and I'm talking, not typing. While I'm doing this, both Claude Code and Cursor Agent are working on the marketing agents repo. So basically I'm doing three tasks at the same time, which is pretty crazy to think about. But yeah, I'm definitely enjoying it.

  While these things are being worked on, I would like to talk about yesterday. We had a great date yesterday, Tanya, Ayka, and Theo went on a small trip. First, they went to a horse club (Koniushnya), and we thought that they would be able to get a small ride on a pony, but we were late, and this sort of stuff kind of finished, so we wrapped up there pretty quickly. Then, they went to a place called Exotic Farm (not far from home) where they have goats, donkeys, emus, ostriches, and played around with dogs and horses and stuff like this. Theo was able to get the small pony ride there. We just had a lot of fun there.

  But the point that I'm making is that when we went back, we went to the supermarket to get some final stuff for the house and then I accidentally somehow - I didn't break the arm, but I don't know how to say it correctly. Accidentally somehow it's not twisted. I don't know how to say it correctly. Вывих in Russian. Theo's arm, and it kind of ruined the whole day because he wasn't able to move his arm. We knew it because that happened before. I'm not sure if I left the journal entry about this. Yeah, we had to go to an emergency room. There was a huge line there, but thankfully the nice people there led us through the line when we asked. It was a quick fix, but yeah, it was very sad because it took like an extra two hours to get there to do all this stuff, and it was me. I'm sad to see my son cry and be in pain, but you know, all is good, everything finished fine, his arm is fine. He has a funny reaction because it happens to him a second time. He did. So the doctor kind of puts the arm back in place, if you will, and then he has to sit there for two minutes, sort of crying because it was painful. Put it back in. But then suddenly he's like "oh oh" he works and raises both hands in the air. Just pretty funny when he does it.

  So everything is fine, and we go home, put him to bed, and relax for the rest of the night. Yeah, that was a fun story yesterday.

10:46 - looking at my book reviews on my personal website, I realized that I tend to be sort of kind or basically giving high ratings when they're not worth it. Usually, 7 and above. Very rarely do I put something below. Maybe be a little more harsh so that the ratings actually do make sense and do have some weight. As opposed to everything I read is good.

13:46 - just used Wispr Flow to dictate a response to a Reddit post, and then used Typing Mind to clean it up. Even in there, in the prompt, I used Wispr Flow. I'm really starting to dig this dictation thing; it's very nice.

That sort of enables me to be more active on social media. I think I can start scheduling, let's say 5-10 minutes a day for any given social media. For example, 9:00 AM is down open my computer. I open up Twitter then instead of typing all the answers, no tweets to replies to single tweets. I just dictate them and then improve them with AI. Maybe Wispr Flow even allows me to do a custom prompt to further enhance the tweet. That'll be nice.

Ну, нет, наверное. (1:14) Только это помогает не злиться.

Как бы, сами по себе, они, наверное, не глупые, просто так устроены. (1:21) Они как испытания. (1:24) С теми вот спокойно.(1:26) Но это, конечно, иногда тяжело. (1:29) Ещё иногда бывает, что получается, что нужно как-то, ну, в кавычках, проиграть. (1:36) Потому что они почувствовали победу, и это может, потому что они более слабые, (1:41) и чувствуют, что хотят какой-то контроль, доминантность, не знаю.(1:44) И самими вот этими вот выходками, самими вот этими вот капризами надо иногда им проигрывать. (1:51) Ну, тяжело. Тяжело.(1:54) Не поймёшь их умом никогда.

23:47 - I'm thinking lately that it is a joy to watch Theodore grow up. He is growing up very quickly, much quicker than before. It's even stupid to say that he's learning new words because he just uses them, doesn't even learn them. He hears them somewhere once and then somehow organically inserts them into sentences, speaks in more fuller sentences now.

It's so fun to watch him try and sometimes stutter, sometimes succeed on the first try. It's just much more fun when he's able to express himself and having fun doing so. He's very happy, he laughs a lot, fun to play with a lot.

He's very stubborn. He doesn't like to play by himself much. He generally asks us to join. He would be a lot nearby, maybe read and then time to time watch him play. But I don't mind. I know that this time will pass. I'd be sad that these days are gone, so trying to enjoy it.

Watching from the sidelines is also fun. I don't always have to play. He's very into cars. Very, very, very much so.

He likes all the general kid stuff: playing, swimming, running, jumping, going on a scooter, all of that. He even likes drawing and dancing. But when it comes to play, cars is basically the only toy he's interested in. I'm interested in how that plays out in the future.

But it's generally a lot of fun. Sometimes work is a little stressful, taking a lot of my time lately, side projects that I'm desperately trying to grow to become a little more independent financially. I definitely don't want to miss my kid's future, current baby state, but I also don't want to fail him in the future.

I want to be my best now so that we can enjoy our lives later. I want to enjoy life too now. I suppose everything's fine. Life is pretty much balanced.

Nothing to complain about too much. Small things here and there, but in general, all good.

13:26 - yesterday was the first fulll day without addicting substances. today is the second. the addiction is much more possible to control then before, for some reason, i'm guessing my dedication and resolve, however... i think is ridicolous. i feel so tired, or more correctly sleepy, all the time! always want to sleep, hard to focus, always hungry, or rather wanting to it... it's hard. But psychologically I don't want to resume usage as much as I did in other times I quit, this time, I think it is for good. The main reason is that i want to be healthy and live as long as possible or my family and set a good example to my son. And also want to be true and relaxed with my wife.

## Journal

10:39 - I just wrapped up my first meditation session. I could stay focused for 10 minutes 23 seconds. My focus was good; obviously, my attention drifted at times, but generally I was good at bringing it back, and it just felt good. The only issue, which I know is expected, is that there were a couple of times I think I was falling asleep. My head was about to drop, but I would catch myself. This is somewhat related to the fact that I didn't sleep much last night, but I'm assuming it will continue even if I get a good night's sleep. I really wanted to finish and then go to sleep, but then I realized that I would probably feel worse, so I decided to slowly wrap up the session and maybe start the workday. 10 minutes 23 seconds is not a bad start. I aim for 15 to 20 minutes every day, right about the same time after I finish with Veo 3 and then just go to my computer. That would be good. Posture-wise, I tried sitting upright in my chair, but obviously, I didn't like feeling too much strain. I probably need to do some stretching. It's a leaning chair, so I leaned back. My head was still somewhat upright, but the rest of my body was leaning back in the chair. These are my notes about my meditation session.

- 17:07 Fux how much I hate women. They are so fucking copmlicated. I guess i sohuld amake it clear that it is not all women. But the women from family. They are so needy, so useless, so annoying.... All they do is bring chaos into life. They do bring life into life, but i think that's the whole point, that's it... They are lying, hypocrite pieces of shit. There is a loneliness pandemic going around where people stay single don't get married... good for them. The only thing in the world that i wouldn't give away is my son. i love him, so, so much. but even he is becoming hard to handle with all the work and side projects. if we figure out a way to make babies without women there would be no need for them any longer. it would be safe to get rid of them. Annoying pieces of shit.
- I'm venting here... perhaps i wouldn't feel that on a regular day, but today i had a fight with my SO and fuck i didn't handle myself and inflicted a bit of physical pain on here. i didn't beat her or anything, but I did grab her by the throat for a second and then pushed on her from aboe while on the bed. it started with her being aggressive that I don't wake up with theo the second he wakes up, (hypocritica, since she basically never wakes up with him...) that got me angry and i pushed her. the she slapped me really hard across the face and i just blew up...
